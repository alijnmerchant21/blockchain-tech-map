# Blockchain Technology Map

This repository holds a Graphviz file as well as a generated SVG file derived from it. The diagram is a hyperlinked map of major components of the decentralized technology stack. The taxonomy is still a work in progress and some classifications can be debated. Feel free to send pull requests if you see gaps or want to fit your favorite project into the map!
